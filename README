Bump is a simple multiplayer web-based physics game.  It consists of two teams
of players within a circular arena, with a special "safe" circle in the center.

A new player is assigned to the team with fewer players and is placed near the
center of the arena.  Moving the cursor within the arena applies thrust in the
direction of the cursor relative to the arena center and proportional to the
distance from the center.

Teams score points by bouncing opponents into the arena perimeter, tapping them
directly, then bouncing them into the perimeter again.

Players that have hit the wall, and possibly an opponent after that, may tap
the center safe circle to reset to normal status.

Once one team reaches 100 points, the scores are reset to 0 and a new game
begins.
